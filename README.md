# a potpourri of career advice from (some of the best) software engineers for new engineers
#### in no particular order of importance, updated periodically:

- go explore various (read: international) work locations. it's hard to do so once you settle down.
- don't go straight into startups as new grad (keep survivorship bias in mind when hearing about the ultra success stories). go to big names with excellent engineering first and work your way up switching teams internally if need be. then go explore startups that want you for your talent and background.
- try as hard as you can to break into big tech companies early in your career, since the expectations are dsa and minimal sys design. this becomes much harder once interviews start focusing on higher level advanced sys design with more yoe.
- check out radically different teams e.g. product vs infra with an open mind. as a young engineer it's very easy to get sucked into doing what you know -> you never really find out what you like and don't like. plus cost of exploration scales inversely with yoe.
- (over)generalized: product teams tend to have faster promos but a glass ceiling. infra teams have slower promos with the benefit of better scaling.
- product teams tend to move much faster than infra. in product the focus is on pushing out a feature in a timely manner whereas infra is much more focused on future-proof engineering and excellent reliability. find out what you like.
- beware overvalued private companies and companies that don't have a clear target consumer.
- when starting your career, don't fall into the rhyme and rhythm of your current role. stay on your feet and more importantly, stay interview ready.
- network, but not for the sake of networking. genuinely try to learn more about people around you and what they are up to, especially from those outside of your immediate or adjacent domains.
- around staff engineer level, ask yourself whether you want to continue down the engineering route or switch to eng management.
- pour mental bandwidth into active soft skills, especially speaking.
- a masters is not needed to be successful in modern industry.
- a masters is needed to be successful in modern industry.
- some companies have a top-down feel to engineering whereas others are bottom-up. typically larger established companies vs smaller startup-like companies. this is also team dependent.
- working at a startup allows you to work on engineering end-to-end albeit around the clock. working at a larger more established tech company usually feels more like a cog in a huge assembly line. the former is not typically sustainable, but is an experience any engineer would benefit from.
- there are no dumb questions, but do your appropriate research before asking.
- this point has been mentioned before, but so many engineers have highlighted this that it deserves to be reiterated: explore, explore, explore. choosing a niche to delve deep into can happen later. breadth is incredibly important for new engineers to see a variety of engineering challenges.
- (try to) be irreplaceable
